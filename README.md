# getKraken
Given a group of sports fans all go in to buy season tickets to the Seattle Krakens, Get Kraken provides a fair way to allow individual members of that group to select which games they will get tickets to.

getKraken offers a fullstack python application with React front end and a docker/django back and middle stacks.
